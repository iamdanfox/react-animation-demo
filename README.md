# About this fork

This is a fork of react-tutorial that supports live editing via **[react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)**.
This means you can edit `CommentBox.jsx` after running the server, and it will update without reload.

--------------------

## To use

```
npm install
node server.js
```

And visit http://localhost:3000/. Try opening multiple tabs!
